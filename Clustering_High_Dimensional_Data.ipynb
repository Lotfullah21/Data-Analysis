        "The goal of supervised learning is clear - we wish to learn a classifier which will predict the labels of future examples as accurately as possible. Furthermore, a supervised learner can estimate the success, or the risk, of its hypothesis using labeled training data by computing empirical loss, in contrast **clustering** is an unsupervised learning problem, namely there are no labels that we try to predict. instead we wish to organize the data in some meaningful way. as a result there is no clear success evaluation procedure for clustering"
